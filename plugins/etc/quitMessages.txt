This is a sign of my determination.
I ... cannot ... lose!
I need your help!
When you fall, you get right back up.
Did I succeed in protecting everyone?
Time to get serious.
This is farewell!
Hasta la vista!
Minimal damages. Preparing for the next battle!
Since I have claimed the victory, one could call me a winner!
I may have shot too many bullets. I hope it does not lead to "lead poisoning".
I made sure to throw in extra rounds, on the house. It's a steal!
Mission complete. No damage to either body or mind. That was a rather good battle.
